sceneindex
48 segmented events
- scene: This is Us Season 1 Episode 1 segmented into 48 events.
- start: Start time of the event. The time index was recorded from Adobe Premiere Pro. To prevent bleeding of audio from one event to the next, manual movie edits were conducted at the start or end of some of the events. The .mp4 files used in the experiment are not shared.
- duration: Duration of the event.
- nTR: Number of TRs the event was played during the fMRI experiment.
- importance: Rated importance of the event, averaged across 8 raters.
- event: Main character(s) of the event.
- description: Short event description by the first author.
- binary indices of which characters appeared and where the event took place.

groupscene
Three scrambled-order groups
- run: Indices of 10 fMRI runs.
- order: Event order within a run. 3 events for run 7 and 5 events for the rest of the runs.
- sceneid: Scene index corresponds to sceneindex.csv.
- blockid: Scene order within a block was fixed, and block order differed across scrambled-order groups.
- char: (1) Jack, (2) Kate, (3) Randall, (4) Kevin, (5) Kevin & Kate.

ahabutton
Moments of aha button presses, in TR resolution
Analysis of the aha button press data is demonstrated in: /code/code_ahasynchrony.py
- subject: 36 fMRI participant index. (Some of the subject numbers are skipped not because they were excluded from analyses, but because either the participant did not show up or they did not complete the scan for some reasons.)
- run: At which fMRI run the button was pressed.
- scene: Corresponds to "order" in groupscene.csv.
- TR (scene): Moments of aha button press (in TR) within the scene duration.
- TR (run): Moments of aha button press (in TR) within the fMRI run duration.
